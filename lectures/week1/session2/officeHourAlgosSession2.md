# 1
Max, Min, Average
Given an array, print the max, min and average values for that array.

# 2
Given an array that could contain indexes of arrays,
determine the amount of numbers in all indexes. Example:
lengthNested([4,[],8,[9,6,3],7]) returns 6.
Do not consider there being a third level of nesting
(something such as [11,[[6]]]).

# 3 
Same as above, but do not count empty indexes.
[6, 4, , 8] should return 3, not 4.
